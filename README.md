# ImportantDirections
**Importand Directions** is a scalable method to construct prediction intervals for large neural networks. The method works with a pretrained network, so you you can use your existing model, but the training set is also required. This repositiry contains a reference implementation of the method and related experiments and accompanies the paper "Scalable computation of prediction intervals for neural networks with matrix sketching", AIST-2021.
